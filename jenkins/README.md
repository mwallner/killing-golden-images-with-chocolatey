## Choco + Jenkins CI examples


### [Check_4_Pkg_Upgrades](../blob/master/jenkins/Check_4_Pkg_Upgrades) 
A job that notifies a mail recipient if packages could be upgraded on the executing Jenkins slave.


### [Internalize_Pkgs](../blob/master/jenkins/Internalize_Pkgs) 
A job that pulls packages (and it's dependencies) from the community repository and pushes it onto a local repository and/or folder.

as those repositories not only contain excellent documentation, but also ready-to-use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) images you can experiment with.
